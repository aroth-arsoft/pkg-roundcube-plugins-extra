This package ships several plugins. To use them, you need to enable
them by adding them to $rcmail_config['plugins'] array in your
`/etc/roundcube/main.inc.php' file.

Some plugins need to be configured directly in
`/etc/roundcube/main.inc.php' while some others have specific
configuration files. For the later, look at
`/etc/roundcube/plugins'. You will find empty files that you can
modify to configure the corresponding plugin.
